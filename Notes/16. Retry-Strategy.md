### ✅ What Is the **Retry Strategy**?

Sometimes, HTTP requests fail due to **temporary issues** (e.g., network glitch, server overload). In these cases, it's smart to **automatically retry** the request after a delay instead of failing immediately.

RxJS provides the `retryWhen()` operator to implement this strategy.

---

### 💡 Code Example

```ts
const courses$ = http$.pipe(
  tap(() => console.log("HTTP request executed")),
  map((res) => Object.values(res["payload"])),
  shareReplay(),
  retryWhen((errors) =>
    errors.pipe(
      delay(2000) // ⏱ wait 2 seconds before retrying
    )
  )
);
```

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

- `http$`: The observable created using `fetch()` inside `createHttpObservable()`.
- `map()`: Transforms the HTTP response to an array of courses.
- `tap()`: Logs whenever the HTTP request is actually executed.
- `shareReplay()`: Ensures the HTTP request is shared (not repeated) across multiple subscribers.
- `retryWhen(errors => ...)`: Handles errors and **decides when to retry**.

---

### 🔁 `retryWhen()` Operator Flow

```text
1. If `http$` fails (e.g., 500 error), it emits an error.
2. `retryWhen()` intercepts the error.
3. It passes the error to the inner observable via `errors.pipe(...)`.
4. Inside `pipe(...)`, we delay the error using `delay(2000)` (or `delayWhen(() => timer(2000))`).
5. After the delay, `retryWhen()` triggers a **new subscription** to `http$`.
6. This loop continues until:
   a) The HTTP request succeeds.
   b) The inner observable completes/errors (retry stops).
```

---

### ✅ Why Use `delay()` or `delayWhen()`?

- `delay(2000)`: Pauses 2 seconds before each retry attempt.
- `delayWhen(() => timer(2000))`: Also pauses 2 seconds — more flexible for dynamic retry delays.

> 🔁 Without delay, retry would happen **instantly** — not recommended for server load or UX.

---

### 📊 Real Use Case Scenario

Let's simulate:

```ts
// Server logic randomly fails 50% of the time
const error = Math.random() >= 0.5;

if (error) {
  res.status(500).json({ message: "random error occurred." });
} else {
  res.status(200).json({ payload: Object.values(COURSES) });
}
```

With `retryWhen()`, even if this API fails at first, **RxJS will retry automatically**.

### 📌 Benefits of the Retry Strategy

| Benefit                           | Description                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Improves resilience            | Recovers from temporary failures                |
| ✅ Better UX                      | No error shown if retry eventually succeeds     |
| ✅ Works well with flaky networks | Ideal for mobile/slow internet                  |
| ✅ Easy to configure              | Control timing & retry attempts with more logic |

### 🆚 Retry vs CatchError

| Feature               | `catchError()`                 | `retryWhen()`                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Purpose               | Handle and potentially recover | Retry failed observable automatically |
| Recovery type         | Switch to fallback observable  | Repeat the same observable            |
| Use case              | Show error, fallback UI        | Recover from **intermittent** errors  |
| Stops on first error? | Yes                            | No (keeps retrying as configured)     |

---

### ✅ Retry With Maximum Attempts

You can limit retries using `take(n)`:

```ts
retryWhen((errors) =>
  errors.pipe(
    delay(2000),
    take(3) // Retry up to 3 times
  )
);
```
