## 🧪 Example: Creating a Custom HTTP Observable

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  const http$ = new Observable((observer: Observer<Response>) => {
    fetch("/api/courses")
      .then((response) => {
        return response.json(); // Parse response as JSON
      })
      .then((body) => {
        observer.next(body);     // Emit the response body
        observer.complete();     // Complete the stream
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        observer.error(err);     // Emit error if fetch fails
      });
  });

  http$.subscribe(
    (courses) => console.log("courses", courses), // onNext
    noop,                                         // onError
    () => console.log("Completed")                // onComplete
  );
}
```

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 📦 What Is Being Done?

1. We're fetching a list of courses from `/api/courses` using the browser’s **Fetch API**.
2. Instead of returning a **Promise**, we wrap the fetch logic inside a **RxJS Observable**.
3. This lets us treat the response as part of a **reactive stream**.

---

## 📘 What Is the `Observable` Constructor?

```ts
new Observable((observer) => { ... })
```

* Allows you to define **how values will be emitted**.
* You use the `observer` to emit:

  * `observer.next(value)` – emits a value
  * `observer.error(err)` – emits an error and ends the stream
  * `observer.complete()` – completes the stream

## 📄 Observable Contract

An Observable must follow three key rules:

| Rule                           | Meaning                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `next` emits values            | Can be called zero or more times               |
| `complete` or `error` is final | Only one of these may be called, and only once |
| After `complete` or `error`    | No further `next` emissions are allowed        |

✅ Our custom Observable correctly follows this contract:

* Emits one value (the HTTP response),
* Then calls `complete()`,
* Or calls `error()` if something goes wrong.

## 🧩 Why Use Observables for HTTP?

| Promises                 | Observables                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| One-time operation       | Multiple or single emissions           |
| Executes immediately     | Executes only on subscription          |
| No built-in cancellation | Can be **unsubscribed** easily         |
| No operators             | Rich **RxJS operators**                |
| Harder to compose        | Easy to **combine with other streams** |

### 🧠 Example Use Cases

* Combine HTTP response with click events
* Add delays, retries, or timeout handling
* Chain with other Observables (`switchMap`, `mergeMap`, etc.)

## 📟 Subscribe with Callbacks

```ts
http$.subscribe(
  (courses) => console.log("courses", courses), // Success
  noop,                                         // Error (No-op for now)
  () => console.log("Completed")                // Completion
);
```

* **Success (`next`)**: Logs the list of courses.
* **Error (`error`)**: Currently using `noop`, a function that does nothing.
* **Complete (`complete`)**: Confirms stream has finished.

> 💡 `noop` is a utility from RxJS that stands for “no operation”.

---

## 📊 Console Behavior

When the app loads:

* No request is made **until you subscribe** to the Observable.
* Upon subscription, the request is fired.
* You’ll see the `courses` object logged.
* Then "Completed" will be printed when the stream finishes.

---

## ✅ Summary

* You can create custom Observables using the `Observable` constructor.
* The observer object allows you to emit values, errors, and completion.
* This gives you full control over stream behavior.
* Wrapping `fetch()` in an Observable opens the door to powerful RxJS composition patterns.
* This Observable only fires when subscribed — making it lazy and cancellable.
