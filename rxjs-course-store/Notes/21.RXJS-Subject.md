# 📘 What is RxJS Subject?

In **RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)**, a `Subject` is a special type of observable that **acts as both an Observable and an Observer**.

It can:

- **Emit values** (like an Observer)
- **Be subscribed to** (like an Observable)

---

## 🔁 Why Use a Subject?

Normally in RxJS, we create observables using:

- `Observable.create()`
- `from()`
- `of()`
- `fromPromise()`
  and so on...

These methods clearly **separate the producer (observer)** and the **consumer (observable)**.

However, in some cases:

- You want to **emit values manually**.
- You're working with a **non-observable data source** (like event callbacks).
- You want to **multicast** (share values with multiple subscribers simultaneously).

👉 In such cases, a `Subject` becomes a very handy tool.

## 🧠 Subject Basics

```ts
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

ngOnInit() {
  const subject = new Subject<number>();

  const series$ = subject.asObservable(); // Convert to Observable to prevent misuse

  // Subscribe to the Observable
  series$.subscribe(value => console.log('Subscriber:', value));

  // Emit values
  subject.next(1);
  subject.next(2);
  subject.next(3);
  subject.complete();
}
```

### Output:

```
Subscriber: 1
Subscriber: 2
Subscriber: 3
```

## 🚦 Subject API

| Method        | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `next(value)` | Emits a new value to all subscribers.           |
| `error(err)`  | Sends an error notification to subscribers.     |
| `complete()`  | Marks the subject as complete (no more values). |

---

## ⚠️ When _Not_ to Use Subject

While `Subject` is powerful, **it can be misused**.

- Sharing a `Subject` across components or services can cause **unexpected behavior**.
- Anyone holding a reference to the subject can call `next()`, `complete()`, or `error()`.
- **No unsubscribe logic** can be directly injected like in `Observable.create()`.

🔒 **Tip:** Always expose `.asObservable()` when sharing a subject to avoid misuse.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases for Subject

- Creating a **custom observable** where standard methods are not sufficient.
- Converting **callback/event systems** into observable streams.
- **Multicasting** data to multiple subscribers (e.g., shared HTTP requests).
- Building custom **state management** (like Redux/Store pattern in Angular).

## 🧪 Variants of Subject

RxJS offers specialized types of subjects:

| Type              | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Subject`         | Basic type, no replay behavior.                                        |
| `BehaviorSubject` | Requires initial value, replays last emitted value to new subscribers. |
| `ReplaySubject`   | Stores a buffer of values and replays them to new subscribers.         |
| `AsyncSubject`    | Only emits the **last** value **on complete()**.                       |

We'll cover these in detail in the next lesson.

## ✅ Summary

- `Subject` bridges the gap between imperative code (manually pushing data) and reactive streams.
- Use with care—**avoid exposing `.next()` externally**.
- Prefer built-in RxJS creation methods when possible.

> “With great power comes great responsibility.” – Apply this to Subjects!
